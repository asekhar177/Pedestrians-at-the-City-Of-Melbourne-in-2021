# Pedestrians at the City Of Melbourne in 2021
This study done in RMarkdown unravels insights into the flow of pedestrians in the City of Melbourne in 2021. These count records were created between January to September 2021 on a monthly basis and sensors were set up in strategic locations to count the number of pedestrians crossing these locations. The dataset itself was compiled by the Melbourne Open Data Portal.

The study was done as part of a course studied under Dr. Petra Graham and Dr. Houying Zhu of Macquarie University. The primary software used was R Markdown, utilising the packages 'dplyr', 'tidyverse', 'pander' and 'ggplot'.
